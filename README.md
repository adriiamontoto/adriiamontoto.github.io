### Target User Profile
The main target for this webpage are companies that want to create a blockchain based system or dapps projects, another possible target is big tech companies that want to improve their blockchain & smart contracts team

### Information Architecture
Basic structure with one page to focus people/recruiters on the main information

### Visual Design
##### Color Palette & Fonts
To develop my personal cv webpage I thought to use a brown palette with some yellows and greens

For the text I have used Roboto font with some variants and diferents sizes (Bold/Regular)

##### Layout
I used a basic layout with a right sidebar and a main body with two parts:
* A static image that in a future can change from a group of images
* A card section where there is all the text

No footer and header were added because I feel is more modern such as **facebook** infinite scroll
